# pyaes_a

This repository encrypt file/s 
using AES GCM 

# SALTER 
salter.py

Auto generates a salt with additional data using pickle and AES GCM

The salt data has secret key and cipher required to encrypt or decrypt the file/folders

# Default password 

b's3kr3tp4ssw0rd'

This is the default password which will be used to generate the secret key and cipher 

# Salt file

salt_data.bin

Contains secret key and cipher used to encrypt or decrypt file/folder 

# Encryptor 

Encrypts a given file or folder 
using salt generated by the salter program
using salt_data.bin file
save it securely


The encrypted file has both the cipher text and the auth tag 
otherwise it technically impossible to decrypt 

# Files required 

salt_data.bin
files/folder to encrypt

# Decryptor 

Decrypts the given file or folder already encrypted 
by using the known salt and  the cipher and authtag provided by the 
encrypted file 

# Files required 

salt_data.bin
decrypted file/folder


# things to do 

1. Split the code into functions (Testing)
2. Eliminate repeated code by using functions (Testing)
3. clean code (To be done in parts)


# how to store my data as encrypted file

1. first run salter.py . This will generate a binary file which will be then used by both the encrypt and decrypt program 
2. Simply run encryptor program by specifying a file or path. It will use the hash and salt generated by the salter code 
3. Even multiple files can be encrypted using single hash/salt 
4. Encrypt file which save the encypted file i.e cipher with the auth tag as the original file,so that it can be decrypted
5. Encryption done . you only need salt_data.bin and your encrypted file 
6. Encrypting multiple times is possible so simply decrypt the same number of times with the salt 

# How to decrypt my data 

1. Make sure the binary data i.e salt_data.bin is available which was generated by the salter program 
2. run decrypt program and provide the path where the encrypted file resides 
3. all files are now decrypted
4. if you had encrypted multiple number of times ,then run this decryptor program the same numbers of times till the original file appears/ is constructed

# Comparison

the pickle module used here can be replaced by json in binary 
as its a binary dictionary object/file 


it may improve speed 

tests are currently being conducted
