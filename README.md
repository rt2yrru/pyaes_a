# pyaes_a

This repository encrypt file/s 
using AES GCM 

# SALTER 
salter.py

Auto generates a salt with additional data using pickle and AES GCM

# Default password 

b's3kr3tp4ssw0rd'

This is the default password which will be auto saved in the generated file 
so change it if you are actually using it 

# Salt file

salt_data.bin

# Encryptor 

Encrypts a given file or folder 
using salt generated by the salter program
using salt_data.bin file
save it securely


The encrypted file has both the cipher text and the auth tag 
otherwise it technically impossible to decrypt 

# Files required 

salt_data.bin
files/folder to encrypt

# Decryptor 

Decrypts the given file or folder already encrypted 
by using the known salt and  the cipher and authtag provided by the 
encrypted file 

# Files required 

salt_data.bin
decrypted file/folder


# things to do 

1. Split the code into functions 
2. Eliminate repeated code by using functions 
3. clean code 


# how to store my data as encrypted file

1. first run salter.py . This will generate a binary file which will be then used by both the encrypt and decrypt program
2. Simply run encryptor program by specifying a file or path. It will use the hash and salt generated by the salter code 
3. Even multiple file can be encrypted using single hash/salt 
4. Encrypt file which save the encypted file i.e cipher with the auth tag aa the original file,so that it can be decrypter 
5. Encryption done . you only need bin data and your encrypted file 
6. Encrypting multiple time is possible so simoly decrypt the same number of times with the salt 

# How to decrypt my data 
1. make sure the binary data is available which was generated by the salt program 
2. run decrypt program and provide the path where the encrypted file resides 
3. all files are now decrypted
4. if you had encrypted multiple number of times ,then run this decryptor rogram the same numbers of time till the original file appears
