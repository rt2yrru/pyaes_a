#SALTER 
salter.py

using salt generated by the salter program

The encrypted file has both the cipher text and the auth tag 
otherwise it technically impossible to decrypt 

#Decryptor 

Decrypts the given file or folder already encrypted 
by using the known salt and  the cipher and authtag provided by the 
encrypted file 


#things to do

2. Eliminate repeated code by using functions 
3. clean code
